This repository contains developer docs for the [PokitDok APIs](https://platform.pokitdok.com)

### Found a bug? Want to help update these docs? Excellent!

### Steps: ###
> Note: Running project locally now requires docker-compose
> available in [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or [Docker For Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)

 1. Fork this repository on Github.
 2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one) to your machine with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/apidocs-v4.git`
 3. `cd apidocs-v4`
 4. Build the docker containers the first time with `docker-compose build` (will likely take a few minutes to download all the requirements)
 5. `docker-compose up`

You can now see the project at <http://localhost:4567>. Great success!
